# React GraphQL Example

This is a simple demonstration of using React with GraphQL. This project is only the front end part. You will need to run [the sample SWAPI GraphQL server](https://github.com/tianbijiang/swapi-graphql) to be able to play with it.

[SWAPI](https://swapi.co/) - the Star Wars API - is just to make things more fun. And the front end is a simple [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) application to list all the Star Wars films and information like characters, descriptions, etc.

[Apollo](http://dev.apollodata.com/react/) is the GraphQL client used in this project.

## Run it

1. Clone the [SWAPI GraphQL server project](https://github.com/tianbijiang/swapi-graphql), and do `npm i` and then `npm start` to get the GraphQL server running.
  
2. Do `npm i` and then `npm start` to run this project.

3. Explore the data itself at http://localhost:8080/ (the Graphiql interface).

## Credit...?

This idea of this project came out of an assignment from one of my interviews.
